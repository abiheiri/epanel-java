Description:
 An application that stores values you type into it. 
        The values save can be commands you would normally type in a terminal or command prompt, they can be folder paths, simple search terms that you would save to search online, or even URLs.
        When you click the launch button it will run as a command, or opens a URL, or searches google if it does not find either appropriate.

Example:
 Suppose you are on a windows machine and you run the command 'gedit'. If it does not exist then it will search online.
        To open a folder in Linux (gnome interface) you add "nautilus /foldername"
        To open a folder in Mac you add "open /Foldername"
        To open a folder in Windows you add "explorer.exe c:\foldername"
